# Tensorflow: neural networks

In this exercise we will implement hand-written digit recognition using Tensorflow neural networks. Our solution won't follow the Coursera exercise, as the propagation is already implemented in Tensorflow. Instead we will focus on:
* training the neural network
* splitting the data into learning set and testing set
* using tensorflow dashboard
* regularization
* using convolutional layers for improving image recognition
